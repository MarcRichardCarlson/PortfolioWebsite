To ensure password security, both bcrypt and bcryptjs were used for hashing. The CMS also incorporates CORS to manage cross-origin resource sharing. For efficient development, I used nodemon to enable automatic server restarts. This project provided valuable insights into backend development, authentication, and data management.",
