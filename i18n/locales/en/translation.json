    "about-header" : "About me",
    "about-text" : "My journey into the world of development began with my interest in computers and technology. I took an additional course in computer and network technology, which sparked my curiosity for programming. To deepen my knowledge and take the next step, I completed a programming course in C#, which provided me with the foundation needed to pursue higher education. This led me to KYH Liljeholmen, where I enrolled in their frontend development program. During my studies, I had the opportunity to build a strong technical foundation and work with tools like React and TypeScript – which quickly became some of my favorites – as well as delve into backend development with C# and .NET. After two intensive and rewarding years, I am now proud to call myself a developer. Today, I apply my technical skill set to exciting projects, including my current collaboration with Gröna Hus and HelloSmart, where I contribute to creating modern and innovative solutions. I am always striving to learn more and constantly seek new opportunities, projects, and collaborations where I can leverage my skills and grow as a developer. Combining technical challenges with creative problem-solving is something I am passionate about, and I look forward to continuing to grow and tackle new challenges in this exciting field.",
