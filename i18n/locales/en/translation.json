This project is a meticulous replica of Discord's interface, focusing solely on the visual aspects without incorporating any functionality. Through this project, I aimed to replicate the look and feel of Discord as closely as possible, enhancing my skills in front-end development and design. The process involved careful attention to detail to ensure that every component matched the original, providing a comprehensive learning experience in UI/UX design.",
    "projects-card-three" : "I built a custom Content Management System (CMS) to enhance my backend development skills. For this project, I utilized ExpressJS to build the server and handle routes. I used Mongoose for database interactions with MongoDB, and jsonwebtoken for implementing authentication and authorization. To ensure password security, both bcrypt and bcryptjs were used for hashing. The CMS also incorporates CORS to manage cross-origin resource sharing. For efficient development, I used nodemon to enable automatic server restarts. This project provided valuable insights into backend development, authentication, and data management.",
