    "about-header": "About me",
    "about-text": "My journey into development began with a deep interest in computers and technology. I started with a course in computer and network technology, which sparked my curiosity about programming. This led to a programming course in C#, providing the foundation I needed to pursue higher education at KYH Liljeholmen's frontend developer program. During my studies, I built strong skills in tools like React and TypeScript, which quickly became favorites, and gained experience in backend development with C# and .NET. After two intensive and rewarding years, I'm proud to call myself a developer. Today, I apply my skills to exciting projects like Gröna Hus and HelloSmart, creating modern and innovative solutions. I'm passionate about combining technical challenges with creative problem-solving and always eager to grow and take on new opportunities.",
