    "about-header": "Carlson – Frontend Developer",
    "about-text": "I’m a passionate Frontend Developer with a knack for crafting smooth, engaging, and high-performance web and mobile applications. With expertise in Next.js, React Native, Tailwind, Framer Motion, Liquid, TypeScript, and JavaScript, I specialize in building intuitive interfaces that not only look great but feel great to use. My experience spans from working with startups and freelancing on full-stack e-commerce solutions to collaborating with established brands like Folkspel, Vattenfall, and Nova 8 during my time at Digital Fans. I thrive in agile environments, where I work closely with backend developers, UX designers, and business teams to deliver polished digital experiences. Beyond work, I enjoy pushing the boundaries of frontend development through independent projects, including my personal portfolio, a Discord skin, and interactive web experiences. I'm always looking to improve, whether by learning new technologies like Flutter & Dart or refining my approach to performance, accessibility, and design. When I’m not coding, you’ll find me experimenting with new tech stacks, optimizing workflows, or figuring out how to take my projects to the next level. Let’s build something amazing!",
